## Getting Started

### Create an application in Django (appone)

To create the "appone" application in your Django project, run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py startapp appone
```

### Existing Django Apps

Check out existing Django apps at [Django Packages](https://djangopackages.org/categories/apps/) to discover and integrate additional functionality into your project.

## Contents of Django Appone

1. **apps.py:** Configuration file for the app within the project.

2. **views.py:** Handles HTTP responses for the browser.

3. **models.py:** Defines data models and tables. Synchronizes data in the database from the defined classes.

4. **admin.py:** Configuration file for the administration interface to manage models.

## Adding Appone to Your Django Project

Navigate to your project directory (e.g., "mywebproject") and open the `settings.py` file. Add the following line to the `INSTALLED_APPS` section:
"appone.apps.ApponeConfig"
```python
# Application definition
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    "appone.apps.ApponeConfig",
]
```

This includes the "appone" app in your Django project.
